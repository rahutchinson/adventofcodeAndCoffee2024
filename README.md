# adventofcodeAndCoffee2024
I take on Advent of Code 2024 along with Onyx coffee's Advent of Coffee 2024!

## Day 1
Sorting and Searching <br />
Copilot Count: 4 (I don't want to write a txt parser or quicksort) <br />
Difficulty: 1/10 Easy as it gets - don't want to scare everyone away.<br /> 

Coffee: Framily <br />
Region: Ethiopia - Great cup of coffee to kick off, really thought the grind size was too big but it was a well balanced cup.<br /> 7/10 <br />

## Day 2
a fun one that I reworked a few times but only because I did not know if golang that a <br /> 
slice `[]int` vs a list `[2] int` are passed to functions differently. Slices pass references to the underlying array while lists do not. But I did <br /> not really know that I was passing slices around which lead to some real issues in part 2 when you need to change the <br /> slice and check to see if it was safe again <br />
Difficulty 5/10 - if it wasn't for my slices it would have been maybe a 3 <br />

Coffee: Mexico José Arguello Natural <br />
Region: Mexico - I like Natural Coffees but have issues extracting them correctly when you have to grind so fine <br /> ended up with a really muddy cup that I want to try again later
?/10 - hopefully rebrew at some later date

## Day 3
all regex and the regex package in golang was solid. "FindAll" then add do's don't - done <br />
Difficulty 1/10 - because regex and golang <br />

Coffee: Ethiopia Habtamu Fekadu Aga <br />
Region: Ethiopia - pretty good cup, I ground it much more coarse then it said. tea-like was a good description <br />
6/10

## Day 4
else if hell - although with the X-Mas part 2 I found an easier way to do it. I will not lie - copilot picked up what I was doing with part one and I might have hit tab on most of the else if checks for the i's and j's<br />
Difficulty 4/10<br />

Coffee: Kenya Gichathaini AA <br />
Region Kenya - really clean cup of cofee, mild with the grapefruit bite, I like when they use the descriptor `juicy` haha not a bad description <br />
7/10

## Day 5
another puzzle where you don't check what is asked for you check the opposite and fail fast - part2 was kind of fun. could have made it cleaner but happy with the out come <br />
Difficulty 3/10<br />

Coffee: Guatemala El Socorro Maracaturra <br />
Region Guatemala - need to rebrew this one too, I really struggle brewing the ones that require a fine grind - the is just merky <br />
?/10

## Day 6
got stuck! in a loop. This one was challenging. It ended up being part 2 and me not documenting enough to catch if it was <br /> in a loop or not. Directions can change but it still in a loop! But also I was logging it at the wrong time. Enjoyed debugging it though - had to take a couple breaks. <br />
5/10 <br />

Coffee -- I'll have a cup after dinner - forgot how it tastes. <br />
