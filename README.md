# adventofcodeAndCoffee2024
I take on Advent of Code 2024 along with Onyx coffee's Advent of Coffee 2024!

## Day 1
Sorting and Searching \
Copilot Count: 4 (I don't want to write a txt parser or quicksort) \
Difficulty: 1/10 Easy as it gets - don't want to scare everyone away.\ 

Coffee: Framily \
Region: Ethiopia - Great cup of coffee to kick off, really thought the grind size was too big but it was a well balanced cup. 7/10 \

## Day 2
a fun one that I reworked a few times but only because I did not know if golang that a \ 
slice `[]int` vs a list `[2] int` are passed to functions differently. Slices pass references to the underlying array while lists do not. But I did \ not really know that I was passing slices around which lead to some real issues in part 2 when you need to change the \ slice and check to see if it was safe again \
Difficulty 5/10 - if it wasn't for my slices it would have been maybe a 3 \

Coffee: Mexico Jos√© Arguello Natural \
Region: Mexico - I like Natural Coffees but have issues extracting them correctly when you have to grind so fine \ ended up with a really muddy cup that I want to try again later
?/10 - hopefully rebrew at some later date
